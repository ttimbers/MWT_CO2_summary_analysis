# Summary analysis of carbon dioxide avoidace experiments on the Multi-worm Tracker
The aim of this project is to create software that can be used after running
a carbon dioxide avoidance experiment using the Multi-worm tracker (Swierczek et al., 2011)
to generate summary figures and statistics for that experiment. Experiment parameters
need to be entered by the user. Please see CO2_driver.sh for details.

## Figures it generates
* Raster plot of speed and direction for each worm from time-1 to time-2
* Turns/minute over the duration of the experiment (sampled every 15s)

## Statistics reported
* To be determined

## How to use it
Instructions to come as code is developed
